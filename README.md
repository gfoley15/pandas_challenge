This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook report created using Pandas for analyzing school district data. The report includes the following sections:

District Summary
- Provides a high-level snapshot of key metrics for the entire district, including:
  - Total number of unique schools
  - Total number of students
  - Total budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage passing math
  - Percentage passing reading
  - Percentage overall passing

School Summary
- Summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  - School name
  - School type
  - Total students
  - Total school budget
  - Per student budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage passing math
  - Percentage passing reading
  - Percentage overall passing
  - Highest-Performing Schools

Lowest-Performing and Highest-Performing schools based on percentage overall passing.

Scores by Grade
- Lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
- Breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. The analysis includes mean scores per spending range and metrics such as average math score, average reading score, percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and percentage overall passing.

Scores by School Size
- Analyzes school performance based on school size categories (small, medium, or large). The analysis categorizes schools by total number of students and provides corresponding performance metrics.

Scores by School Type
- Analyzes school performance based on school type (charter or district). The analysis uses the per-school summary DataFrame to show performance metrics for each school type.

Trends
The report includes written descriptions observable trends based on the data analyzed. Data analysis provided in Jupyter Notebook.
