    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary.\n",
    "The school district analysis provides an overview of key data points for each school in the district, including student count, school type, and budget. \r\n",
    "It averages math and reading scores and calculates percent passing rates to evaluate the performance of each school.\r\n",
    "Further analysis is conducted to examine scores and passing rates based on spending/budget tier, school size, and school type. \r\n",
    "This in-depth examination allows for conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of school budget, size, and type on academic success, as measured by scores and passing rate\n",
    "## Conclusions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Charter schools consistently outperform District schools in math/reading scores and passing rates (overall passing rates included).\r\n",
    "The overall passing rate is significantly higher at Charter schools than District schools - 90.43% to 53.67% respectiely. \r\n",
    "Also, when broken down to the individual school level, the Top 5 schools in the district are Charter schools and the bottom 5 are Di trict.\r\n",
    "As a whole, Charter school students are having more academic success when compared to the District school s udents.\r\n",
    "This indicates Charter schools may have more effective academic curriculum or more robust resourcing for cl ssrooms.\r\n",
    "A possible reason for Charter schools having a positive correlation with higher average scores and passing rates can be found when reviewing spendi g budget.\r\n",
    "Despite lower total spending budgets, Charter schools allocate their resources with a heavier focus on academic success, resulting in higher student a hievement.\r\n",
    "While District schools had higher spending budgets, the allocation of resources may not be as targeted towards academic success as in Chartr schools. \r\n",
    "In sum, school type has a significant impact on academic performance and how budgets are utilized is more critical than the total amount of spending budget in influencing academic outcomes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. Small to medium sized schools have higher average scores and passing rates than large schools. Small schools specifically have the highest average scores for m th and reading.\r\n",
    "This suggests small and medium sized schools may provide an environment more conducive to learning and acad mic performance.\r\n",
    "Small to medium sized schools have less students to manage, and therefore may be able to cater curriculums or programs to student's learning styles. This helpful attribute could postiively impact\r\n",
    "student's ability to focus, learn and perform at a high level. Since larger schools have more students and potentially limited staff resources per student compared to small or me ium sized schools,\r\n",
    "individualized curriculums or smaller group learning is not a viable option. Without small/medium sized group learning, education quality and student scores are negateively impacted. Large schools c uld consider moving\r\n",
    "to a new curriculum that matches how small and medium sized schools approach their curriculum as well as reviewing the potential need to hire more staff members to provide more individualized supp rt for all students.\r\n",
    "There is also a relationship between school size and school type. All small and medium sized schools are Charter schools, thus the points made above also apply. In sum, a smaller school size positively\r\n",
    "impacts academic performance suggesting that schools should consider the benefits of smaller class sizes and tailored educational approachupport students.\n",
